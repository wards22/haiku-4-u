# haiku-4-u
Class project for CS3300 - Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

This program asks users to enter three lines, one at a time, to form a haiku. If the proper syllable structure is present (5 syllables for line 1, 7 syllables
for line 2, and 5 syllables for line 3), it will congratulate the user and ask if they want to print out a QR code of their haiku. If the proper syllable
structure is not met, it will ask if the user wants to try again.
